4. Learn past reports of Code4rena
https://code4rena.com/reports/
It is good to learn at least all the reports on the contests held this year.
Gas Optimization focuses on High/Med/Low because the prize money is small and it is not considered in other competitions.


5. Real contests

By creating a Discord account, you can immediately login and participate in contests. 
If you go to Discord's resources, you can find more learning materials.
It is good to start with projects that have recently started as prize money is awarded only to the first person who finds a mistake. 
In principle, the report must be submitted within 3 days after the project is released.

First, you should understand how it works through Docs.
Once you have created a Discord account and approved, you can enter the contest.
